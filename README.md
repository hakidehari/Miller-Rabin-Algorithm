# Miller-Rabin-Algorithm
An implementation of an algorithm in java that tests whether an extremely large number is a probable prime.

The task was to implement an RSA encryption algorithm using Java.  My task was to implement a function that generated two extremely large probable prime numbers.  To tell whether the large number was a prime, I implemented the Miller-Rabin test for a probable prime.
